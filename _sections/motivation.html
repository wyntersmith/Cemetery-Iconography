The original goal of this project was to find a relation between gravestone iconography and atypical burial practices. Due to the high volume of graves we canvased and the difficulty in determining if each burial was atypical or not, we instead chose to focus on the meaning and commonalities of different gravestone iconographies used in burial practices over time. Due to our shift in focus, our background information mostly relates to atypical burial practices, and our research questions have changed. </p>
