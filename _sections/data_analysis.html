<p> To analyze the data we collected, we used our SQL database in order to determine the popularity of icons and epitaphs over a period of time. We initially separated our results by cemetery, looking for the most common icons and epitaphs from the data collected, as well as the most popular in the cemetery over the years. This data was then compared over all of the cemeteries in order to see trends in iconography throughout London as a whole. </p>
