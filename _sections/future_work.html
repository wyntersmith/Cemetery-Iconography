<p> In the future, we would like to return to our original analysis goal of determining and analyzing iconography of atypical burials compared to other burials. We would also like to further expand on this work with more insight into the deceased to help evaluate and gain a deeper understanding of the different iconography and epitaphs commonly used in burials. We could do this by gathering more information about the deceased, such as: </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Sex</li>
  <li>Date of Birth</li>
  <li>Place of Birth</li>
  <li> Occupation </li>
  <li> Title </li>
  <li> Age </li>
</ul>
<p> In the future, we would also like to redo the dataset in order to more accurately depict each grave. We would do this by changing the Headstone and Deceased tables, replacing GraveID with DeceasedID in the deceased table, and then using GraveID to mark the grave each deceased person is buried in. From there, the Headstone table would have primary key GraveID, and would list the icons and epitaphs on each headstone instead of directly associating it with the deceased. </p>
