<p> Burial practices are a very diverse way of expressing identity. Over time, burial practices have evolved with religious, political, and societal views (Evans, L. , 2020). Because of this, it is important to evaluate burials in respect to their time period (Buckberry, J., & Cherryson, A. 2016) and events that may have been occurring during that time, such as war or widespread disease (Arnold, C. , 2008). It is also important to examine possible effects that location, colonization, and religion have on not only the original society's burial practices, but the affected culture's own practices (Hayward SF. 2018). </p>

<p> There are many reasons a burial might stray from “normal” burial practices in a selected societal group or time. Most deviant burials likely do not have a superstitious origin, and their interpretations have been skewed and misinformed due to popular media (Gardeła, L. 2015), and thus need to be reevaluated through a different lens (Melvin, S., 2022), such as judiciary standards of the time (Gardeła, L., & Kajkowski, K. , 2013). Generally, deviant burials seem to be influenced by social stigma (Gregoricka, L. A., Scott, A. B., Betsinger, T. K., & Polcyn, M. , 2017), and those who underwent deviant burials went against societal expectations in some way, such as illegitimate children, criminals, etc. (Hodgson, J. E. , 2013). Some of these societal expectations caused them to be accused of witchcraft (Program, R. M. G. D. J. (Ed.). 2006) and undergo unfair and cruel torture (Ewen, L. C. 2011). Others, such as children (Murphy, E. M., & Roy, L. M. 2018) and also those who were perceived as “vampires" had superstitious rituals performed to them after death (Barber, P. 2010).</p>

<p> The symbols and epitaphs on each gravestone can be used to help understand and identify the type of person buried there, as well as how they were viewed by others (Cogan, D. A. 2013). Most symbols and epitaphs present on gravestones are religious in nature, generally presenting a positive outlook on death. A large portion is also related to plants . There don't seem to be many with negative connotations for the dead. There are many different reasons why a specific one may be used on any given headstone, such as showing familial ties or honoring the dead (Nutty, C. L. , 1978) . The aspects of the gravestone, such as material, epitaphs, symbols, etc., are influenced not only by religion, but also social status, occupation, and societal standards (Gorman, F. J., & DiBlasi, M. , 1981) We can use many sources to gather evidence and insight to these identifying pieces using tools at our disposal, such as the London Metropolitan Archives and Find a Grave. How can we then use these identifying pieces to create a narrative for the lives the people lived? There are many factors to consider not only from the historical perspective, but also how our own personal assumptions and biases affect our perception (MacIntyre, B., David Bolter, J., & Maribeth, G. 2004). When examining this closer, we also found that the term ‘deviant’ in itself has a negative connotation towards being ‘criminal’ or another sort of outcast in the archaeological field. The term is used much too widely in articles and studies, and my group has decided after research to use the term ‘non-normative’ or ‘atypical’ in substitution for this term in order to include a broader range of identities without having a stigmatic connotation attached (Murphy, E. M. 2008).</p>
